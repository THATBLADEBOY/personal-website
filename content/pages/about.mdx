## background

I've always been captivated with DIY cultures about creativity
and rebellion like skating, punk rock, and hip-hop. I found my
passion for creating things through streetwear. While going
through business school, I built a small brand that was featured
as "the future of the streetwear industry" in the documentary [Built to Fail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA5EKQSU670 "Built to Fail").

I found my passion for development after building my brand's
website and decided to dive headfirst into the software world. I
gave up the silk screens for computer screens.

Now, I'm a full-stack developer at [Relode](https://www.relode.com/ "Relode")
and founder of [woch.io](https://www.woch.io/ "woch"). I regularly volunteer at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/ "Nashville Software School")
as a tutor and mentor.
